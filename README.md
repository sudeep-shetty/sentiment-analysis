to run the project
  i) you need to be able to run python
  ii)run the code in file name "thepythoncode" "test1" and "train1" are testing and training datasets result is in file named "result"
  
  
I suggest using ipython for best results
 steps to run code in ipython
  i)open the folder exec in ipython
  ii)you will find a file by name "code" run this code and you have the results

you can change the training and testing data set names to run other files. but you will also have to make other changes based on your file
